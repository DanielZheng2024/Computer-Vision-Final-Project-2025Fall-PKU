# Computer-Vision-Final-Project-2025Fall-PKU
Provides the supplementary details for the Project on 'Creating Visual Cognitive Illusions'.

## Important

**Be sure to go into the 'Supplementary Details' folder, as all run-instructions are clearly listed in Readme.md under that folder.

## For Fun

- **We implemented a interactive demo webpage.**You can run it by first downloading all the stuff, then run Generate_Website.py
  - Note that you need to keep it in the root directory
  - you have to perform `pip install streamlit`
  - After the above, run `streamlit run Generate_Website.py`

## Thanks for running our project!
